					consumers that like to watch short films.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first question that we had to answer was based around discovery, how are consumers going to
					find and interact with MOFILM?
				</p>
				<p>
					Mobile phones are the ideal medium for watching our short films, with over 950 million handsets
					being sold last year alone. In many emerging territories more people have access to the mobile
					phone than they do the internet. MOBILE entertainment is growing due to handset manufacturers
					continually updating and improving on the quality of the product, larger screens and flat rate
					data tariffs along with educating consumers on how to use the mobile internet has influenced our
					success.

					Operators in 23 countries, we have also created a mobile internet application to allow all
					handsets with a mobile browser to view our short films.
				</p>
				<p>
					All the consumer needs to do is to type <a href="http://www.mofilm.com">www.mofilm.com</a> into
					a mobile internet browser in order to download or stream MOFILM content.
				</p>
				<p>
					MOFILM have also created specific device applications, and continue to do so.
				</p>
				<p>
					We support iPhone Apps, Blackberry RIM applications and Android Handset Applications, we are also
					showcasing MOFILM content on NOKIA OVI and continue to work with handset manufacturers to pre
					install MOFILM content and the MOFILM MOBILE application.
				</p>

					mobile advertising to generate revenues, we also license content and sell content at a premium
					rate. At each point you will receive 50% net revenues from your content.
