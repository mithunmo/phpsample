			<h2>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			
			<h3>What is SouthBytes?</h3>
SouthBytes is a brand new competition at SXSW 2011. Everyone can&#8217;t make it to SXSW this year, but since you did we want you all to be the roaming reporters/stars on the event floor helping to create the video voice of SXSW.

We want short snippets about SXSW that will make the folks back home jealous and other attendees wish they hadn&#8217;t missed out on what you&#8217;ve seen and done.

			<h3>How do enter?</h3>
There are three ways to get your entry in:

			<ul style="list-style:none; line-height:20px;">
				<li>1.	Create your film, visit http://south-bytes.com and hit the upload button.</li>
				<li>2.	Grab one of our lovely roving film crews and do a piece direct to camera, or give them direction on what you&#8217;d like captured.</li>
				<li>They will then take it back to base, edit if needed and upload it for you.</li>
				<li>3.	You can drop by the MOFILM SouthBytes stand and do a piece straight to camera there.</li>
			</ul>

We&#8217;ll edit if need and upload it for you.

If you chose option 2 or 3 we&#8217;ll get in touch to let you know when your spot is up so you can share it around your friends and network

			<h3>How long should it be?</h3>
Ideally around 30 seconds, definitely no more than 40, but it can be as shorter than that too.

			<h3>Can I submit more than one video?</h3>
You can submit as many videos as you like, as long as they are all different

			<h3>Are there any restrictions on filming at SXSW?</h3>
As long as you are using a  non-invasive, personal camera and shoot you're your seat you can record any of the film and interactive sessions for up to 45 seconds.  To make sure that you don&#8217;t go over this we&#8217;re limiting the entries to SouthBytes to 40 seconds maximum.

			<h3>Do I need to get permission from anyone?</h3>
It depends. If you&#8217;re filming a panel session for your entry then you don&#8217;t need to ask permission. The same goes for people in the background when you film. However if you are filming someone doing something specific,  a street performer for example., then you should ask their permission.

			<h3>How do I win?</h3>
By telling us the most interesting, inspiring, surprising, wackiest, intriguing, fascinating thing about any of the three SXSW festivals.

We want our jury of hardened SXSW attendees to go &#8216;Wow, I never knew that&#8217; or &#8216;I wish I&#8217;d been there to see that&#8217;

We&#8217;re judging on content but adding some flair always helps too

			<h3>When will you be announcing the winners? And how will winners be notified?</h3>
Winners will be announced on the South-Bytes website on Thursday afternoon by 15.30pm CT and on the Next stage at 16:00 CT

			<h3>What do I win?</h3>
We&#8217;ve got a free limited edition SouthBytes 2011 t-shirts to give away &#8211; just come by the MOFILM stand at Film Poster Gallery, Austin Convention Centre.

There are also two trips to TriBeCa film festival up for grabs. We&#8217;ll pay for flights and accommodation. We&#8217;ll also take you out and show a more than wonderful time at the MOFILM TriBeCa awards.

If you aren&#8217;t resident in the USA we&#8217;ll take you to the nearest MOFILM awards event, which could be London, Rome or even Rio de Janerio.

			<h3>Who&#8217;s on the judging panel?</h3>
