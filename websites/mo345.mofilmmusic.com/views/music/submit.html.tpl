			<ul class="terms">
				<li class="terms">Submitting to make your music available to the worldâ€™s biggest brands via the MOMOMUSIC platform is easy. Simply upload four (4) MP3 tracks and we'll review them within sixty days.</li>
				<li class="terms">MOMUSIC is very specific about the music it represents. We're looking for excellent musicianship, originality and high quality production values. Make sure the material you submit is yours - written and recorded by you. No sampled and no covers please. If other parties collaborated with you on the relevant musical compositions and/or the recording, they will be asked to sign a release of rights to permit us to make the music available on our platform, if your music is accepted. Any music that does not meet these criteria will be rejected.</li>

				<li class="terms">Once we receive your submission it will go through a review process. If your music is approved, we will send you a notice and invite you into the catalogue, outlining the next steps. If your music isn't quite what we're looking for, we'll certainly send you a notice as well. If your audition isn't accepted, don't fret. You can always audition more songs in the future.</li>

				<li class="terms"> If your music is accepted, anyone who owns any part of the master recording or the publishing, or anyone who has rights over the music in any way must sign our Standard Writer Artist Music Supply agreement prior to final acceptance.</li>

				<li class="terms">Once all the paperwork is signed and sealed, your music will be added to the player and ready to be licensed</li>
