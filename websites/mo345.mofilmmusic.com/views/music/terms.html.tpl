			<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>

			<p>1.		Downloading Music </p>

			<p>1.1	Upon your registration with either MOFILM or MOMUSIC websites, we grant you a limited license to download any musical track included on MOMUSIC platform (the “Recording”) for the purpose of assessing quality and suitability of the Recording(s) for your audio-video projects.</p>

			<p>1.2	This license also includes the right to synchronize any Recording with audio-video content for the exclusive purpose of, or otherwise incidental to, your participation in MOFILM film Competitions or other projects supervised by MOFILM from time to time.</p>

			<p>1.3	You may also retain the copy of the Recording, as synchronized with audio-video content produced by you for MOFILM, for your personal or educational (but not commercial) usage, by way of posting on your own website(s) and own social network accounts or presenting such audio-video content in academic projects, after the conclusion of any relevant MOFILM Competition for which such audio-video content was produced.</p>

			<p>1.4	This license is revocable at any time and does not permit you: (a) to distribute or make available the Recording to any third party, whether for material gain or on gratuitous basis, or (b) to use or exploit the Recording on a standalone basis, except as provided by Section 1.1 hereunder, or (c) to synchronize the Recording with any content not produced by you for the purpose of, or otherwise incidental to, your participation in MOFILM film Competitions, or (d) to otherwise use or exploit such Recording for any purposes other than set out hereunder.</p>

			<p>1.5	If you wish to use the Recording for purposes not set out hereunder, please contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:license@mofilm.com"> license@mofilm.com</a></strong> and we will endeavor to assist you. </p>


			<p>2.	Submitting Own Music </p>

			<p>2.1	Submitting to make your music available to the world’s biggest brands via the MOMOMUSIC platform is easy. Simply upload four (4) MP3 tracks and we'll review them within sixty days.</p>
			<p>2.2	MOMUSIC is very specific about the music it represents. We're looking for excellent musicianship, originality and high quality production values. Make sure the material you submit is yours - written and recorded by you. No sampled and no covers please. If other parties collaborated with you on the relevant musical compositions and/or the recording, they will be asked to sign a release of rights to permit us to make the music available on our platform, if your music is accepted. Any music that does not meet these criteria will be rejected.</p>

			<p>2.3	Once we receive your submission it will go through a review process. If your music is approved, we will send you a notice and invite you into the catalogue, outlining the next steps. If your music isn't quite what we're looking for, we'll certainly send you a notice as well. If your audition isn't accepted, don't fret. You can always audition more songs in the future.</p>

			<p>2.4	If your music is accepted, anyone who owns any part of the master recording or the publishing, or anyone who has rights over the music in any way must sign our Standard Writer Artist Music Supply agreement prior to final acceptance. </p>

			<p>2.5	Once all the paperwork is signed and sealed, your music will be added to the player and ready to be licensed </p>
